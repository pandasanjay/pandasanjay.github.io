| **Overall Purpose** | **Main Theme/Purpose** | To establish a modern, professional online presence for Sanjay Kumar Panda, showcasing his expertise and passion as a **Developer Advocate**, **AI Enthusiast**, and **Content Creator**, built upon his solid **Software/Data Engineering** foundation. The page should convey technical depth, community engagement, and active learning.                       | Defines the core objective and target audience perception.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Design & Style** | **Concept** | "The Focused Flow" - Minimalist, clean, modern, potentially leaning towards a simple futuristic aesthetic. Prioritizes clarity, readability, and ease of navigation.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Guides the overall look and feel, ensuring simplicity despite the technical nature of the content.                                                                                              |
|                      | **Color Scheme** | **Preference:** Dark theme. Example: Dark slate/charcoal backgrounds (e.g., `#0f172a`), light text (e.g., `#cbd5e1`), and a vibrant accent color (e.g., Electric Cyan `#06b6d4`) for headings, links, and key highlights. (Open to other modern dark themes).                                                                                                 | Specifies visual preference for a futuristic but simple look.                                                                                                                                   |
|                      | **Design Preferences** | Ample whitespace, clean sans-serif typography (e.g., Inter), subtle hover effects (e.g., glow, color change), smooth scrolling, potentially subtle section load animations (fade-in). Avoid overly complex or distracting visuals. Fully responsive design (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).                                                                         | Ensures a polished, professional user experience across devices.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Framework** | **Frontend Framework** | **Preference:** Open, but examples provided use **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development and easy customization. Comfortable with static site generators (Gates By) or component-based frameworks (React, Vue) if deemed beneficial for future expansion (e.g., integrating a full blog).                                                     | Specifies technical preference while remaining flexible. Tailwind CSS aligns with the provided examples.                                                                                       |
| **Key Sections** | **Hero Section** | Headline, Tagline, Professional Photo, Key Social/Professional Links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Website/Blog). Should immediately convey the core focus (DevRel, AI, Content).                                                                                                                                                                                    | Creates the first impression and directs users to key external profiles.                                                                                                                       |
